Chapter 7: Transforming Time Management Practice from Reactive to Proactive and Strategic
=========================================================================================

In this chapter, we will explore the transformation of time management practices from reactive, ad-hoc approaches to proactive and strategic methodologies, all with the assistance of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Proactive time management allows individuals and organizations to take control of their schedules, prioritize effectively, and align their activities with strategic goals. We will delve into various techniques and strategies to harness AI for this transformation.
